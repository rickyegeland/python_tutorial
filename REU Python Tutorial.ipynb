    "In Science, data formats are as numerous as the stars.  What we have done above is to write a very basic **parser** for a very simple file format.  What you should strive to do is to **never write a parser if you don't have to**.  In general, writing parsers is very time consuming and error prone.  While data you will encounter will arrive in many different formats, there are also many different genreral-purpose parsers available to handle those formats.  Later in this tutorial we will introduce the `numpy` and `astropy` parsers which can save you some time reading in ASCII-formatted data, which is extremely common."

If no code catches the `Exception`, execution stops and you will usually see a stack trace, which informs you what the `Exception` was and where it occurred.  Then you get to go into the exciting world of debugging, where you will spend most of your working hours."

[Documentation is here.](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/).  Recall earlier we read in the Sac Peak Ca K data, which has time in separate columns of year, month, and day, which is not very useful for plotting.
